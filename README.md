# Behavioral Cloning Project (P3)

This repository contains my solution to the Udacity Self-Driving Car NanoDegree Behavioral Cloning project.

The repositry contains the following required files:

* [Training.ipynb](Training.ipynb) Jupyter notebook that contains the Python code to create and train the model
* `drive.py` for driving the car in autonomous mode. To this file, I added code to pre-crop incoming images from the simulator
* `video.py`for recording video
* `vgg_256_128.h5` trained convolutional neural network to drive the car
* `writeup_report.md` this file, containing the writeup report that summarizes the results.
